This program draws 100 circles with random size, position, and color. 

Here is a quick test of the program:

Use Cases:

 - Artwork for a website that is unique for every user's experience. 

Problems:

 - I do not see any current problems with the code, the circles do overlap though which I think is cool for aesthetics.
